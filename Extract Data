1) What are the most common outage types?

SELECT
COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE YEAR(Start_Time) IN ('2016','2017')
AND Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Year, Status, Reason
ORDER BY Year, Total_Number_Outage_Events DESC

2) How long do they tend to last?

SELECT
Status, Reason, COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, 
ROUND(((AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,Start_Time, End_Time)))/60)/24,2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days,
YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE YEAR(Start_Time) IN ('2016','2017')
AND Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year,Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days DESC

3) How frequently do the outages occur?

SELECT
Status, Reason, COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, 
MONTH(Start_Time) AS Month
FROM AEMR
WHERE YEAR(Start_Time) IN ('2016','2017')
AND Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Status, Reason, Month
ORDER BY Reason, Month

4) Are there any energy providers that have more outages than their peers which may indicate that these providers are unreliable?

SELECT
COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, Participant_Code, Status, YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code,Status,YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time),Participant_Code

SELECT 
Participant_Code,Status,YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year,
ROUND(AVG((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60)/24),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code,Status,YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time),CAST(Avg(CAST(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY,Start_Time,End_Time)AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS DECIMAL(18,2)) DESC

5) Of the outage types in 2016 and 2017, what percent were forced outages?

SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = 'Forced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_Number_Forced_Outage_Events,  
COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
CAST((CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = 'Forced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS DECIMAL(18,2))/CAST(Count(*) AS DECIMAL(18,2)))*100 AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS Forced_Outage_Percentage,
YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status = 'Approved'
GROUP BY YEAR(Start_Time)

6) What was the average duration for a forced outage during both 2016 and 2017? Have we seen an increase in the average duration of forced outages?

SELECT Status,Reason,YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year,
ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
Cast(ROUND(AVG(Cast(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time) AS DECIMAL(18,2))),2) AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' 
GROUP BY Status,Reason,YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time),Reason

7) Which energy providers tended to be the most unreliable?
SELECT Participant_Code,Facility_Code,Status,YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year,
ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
ROUND(SUM(Outage_MW),2) AS Summed_Energy_Lost
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND Reason='Forced'
GROUP BY Participant_Code,Facility_Code,Status,YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time) ASC,ROUND(SUM(Outage_MW),2) DESC
